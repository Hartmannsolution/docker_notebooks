    "\n",
    "### The project description\n",
    "A description of the project (a project proposal) must be finalized at latest on the monday of the first week og the project period. To get the project proposal aproved each group must send it to pythonvalg@gmail.com no later than thursday the week before (week 13 of the course).  \n",
    "The proposal must contain the following 3 points:\n",
    "0. Group name and group members\n",
    "1. Description of the data (with a link to the data source)\n",
    "2. Description of the proplem (what questions to ask the data)\n",
    "3. What technologies (libraries) will be used\n",
    "4. What will be the main challenge(s) in the project\n",
    "\n",

    "  - Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and transforming data for analysis\n",
    "- Transformation\n",
    "  - Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of datasets to derive new datasets (e.g., aggregating a large table by group variables in numpy and/or pandas)\n",
    "- Modeling and computation\n",
    "  - Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other computational tools\n",
    "- Presentation\n",

    "### Exam question\n",
    "These are examples of general [exam questions ](exam_questions.md) from the curriculum, but mainly questions will be to the code you have developed (unless the project is very small)\n",
