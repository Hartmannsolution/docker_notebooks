    "1. Create 5 list comprehensions to solve the following 5 problems:\n",
    "  1. Iterate a list of names to return a list of the names starting with H\n",
    "  2. In one line create a list of the numbers 1-100 to the power of 3\n",
    "  3. Iterate a list of names to create a list of tuples where the tuples first value is the length of the name and the second is the name\n",
    "  4. Iterate over each character in a string and get only those that are nummeric\n",
    "  5. Using only a list comprehension wrapped in set() get all possible combination from throwing 2 dice\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create 2 dictionary comprehensions to solve the following:\n",
    "  1. Iterate a list of names and create a dictionary where key is the name and value is the length of the name\n",
    "  2. Iterate a list of numbers and create a dictionary with (key, value) being (number, squareroot of number)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Progammatically using loops create a small program to produce a dictionary with all the 2 dice throw combinations as keys and their likelyhood in percent as values"
