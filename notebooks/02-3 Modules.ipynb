    "#### Modular code\n",
    "One advantage of functions is the way they separate blocks of code from your main program. By using descriptive names for your functions, your main program will be much easier to follow. You can go a step further by storing your functions in a separate file called a module and then importing that module into your main program. An import statement tells Python to make the code in a module available in the currently running program file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing your functions in a separate file allows you to hide the details of your program’s code and focus on its higher-level logic. It also allows you to reuse functions in many different programs. When you store your functions in separate files, you can share those files with other programmers without having to share your entire program. Knowing how to `import` functions also allows you to use libraries of functions that other programmers have written.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing an Entire Module\n",
    "\n",
    "To start importing functions, we first need to create a module. A module is a file ending in `.py` that contains the code you want to import into your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a function from an imported module, enter the name of the module you imported followed by the name of the function separated by a dot.\n",
    "\n",

The function shall have the following signature `download(url, to=None)` where the keyword argument `to` specifies where to save a file locally and with which name. If `to == None` then the file shall be saved in the current working directory `./` with the same name as it has at its origin. For example, calling your program as in the following\n",
