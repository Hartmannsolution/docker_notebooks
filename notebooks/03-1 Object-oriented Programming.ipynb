    "# Object-oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is one of the most common ways to write and structure software. In object-oriented programming you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general\n",
    "behavior that a whole category of objects can have. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making an object from a class is called *instantiation*, and you work with instances of a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Using a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "You can model almost anything using classes. Let’s start by writing a simple class, `Book`, that represents a book and its contents—not one book in particular, but any book. What do we know about most books? Well, they likely all have a *title* an *author*, and contain some *chapters*. We also know that you can *read* books and *open* them to inspect them further. Those two pieces of information (title and author) and those two behaviors (read and open) will be constituents of our Book class because they are common to most books. After our class is written, we will use it to create individual instances, each of which represents one specific book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Book Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance created from the Book class will store a `title` an `author`, and its `chapters`, and we will give each book the 'ability' to get `read()` and to get opened `open_book()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The __init__() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that’s part of a class is a *method*. Everything you learned about functions applies to methods as well; the only practical difference for now is the way we will call methods. The `__init__()` method is a special method Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the `Book` class. This method has two leading underscores and two trailing underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python’s default method names from conflicting with your method names.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the `__init__()` method to have four parameters: `self`, `title`, `author`, and `chapters=`. The `self` parameter is **required** in the method definition, and it must come **first** before the other parameters. It must be included in the definition because when Python calls this `__init__()` method later (to create an instance of `Book`), the method call will automatically pass the `self` argument. Every method call associated with a class automatically passes `self`, which\n",
    "is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an instance of `Book`, Python will call the `__init__()` method from the `Book` class. We will pass `Book()` a `title`, an `author`, and `chapters=` as arguments; `self` is passed automatically, so we do not need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an instance from the`Book` class, we will provide values for only the last three parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three variables defined each have the prefix `self`. Any variable prefixed with `self` is available to every method in the class, and we will also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. `self.title = title` takes the value stored in the parameter name and stores it in the variable name, which is then attached to the instance being created. Variables that are accessible through instances like this are called attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Book` class has two other methods: `read` and `open`. The instances we create later will have access to these methods."

    "### Making an Instance from a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance. The class `Book` is a set of instructions that tells Python how to make individual instances representing specific books.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tell Python to create a book whose title is `'The Book of Silence'` and whose author is `'Nobody'`. When Python reads the line, `silent_book = Book('The Book of Silence', 'Nobody')` it calls the `__init__()` method in `Book` with the arguments `'The Book of Silence'` and `'Nobody'`. The `__init__()` method creates an instance representing this particular book and sets the `author` and `title` attributes using the values we provided. The `__init__()` method has no explicit return statement, but Python automatically returns an instance representing this book. We store that instance in the variable `empty_book`. The *naming convention* is helpful here: we can usually assume that a capitalized name like `Book` refers to a class, and a lowercase name like `empty_book` refers to a single instance created from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the attributes of an instance, you use 'dot' notation. We access the value of `empty_book`’s attribute `author` by writing: `empty_book.author`."

      "Bones gave a resigned sigh.\n",
      "\"I'm expecting----\" he began, when a silvery bell tinkled.\n",
      "It was silvery because the bell was of silver.  Bones looked up, pulled\n",
      "down his waistcoat, smoothed back his hair, fixed his eye-glass, and\n",
      "took up a long quill pen with a vivid purple feather.\n",
      "\"Show them in,\" he said gruffly.\n",
      "\"Them\" was one well-dressed young man in a shiny silk hat, who, when\n",
      "admitted to the inner sanctum, came soberly across the room, balancing\n",
      "his hat.\n",
      "\"Ah, Mr. Pole--Mr. Fred Pole.\"  Bones read the visitor's card with the\n",
      "scowl which he adopted for business hours.  \"Yes, yes.  Be seated, Mr.\n",
      "Pole.  I shall not keep you a minute.\"\n",
      "He had been waiting all the morning for Mr. Pole.  He had been weaving\n",
      "dreams from the letter-heading above Mr. Pole's letter.\n",
      "Ships ... ships ... house-flags ... brass-buttoned owners....\n",
      "He waved Mr. Fred to a chair and wrote furiously.  This frantic\n",
      "pressure of work was a phenomenon which invariably coincided with the\n",
      "arrival of a visitor.  It was, I think, partly due to nervousness and\n",
      "partly to his dislike of strangers.  Presently he finished, blotted the\n",
      "paper, stuck it in an envelope, addressed it, and placed it in his\n",
      "drawer.  Then he took up the card.\n",
      "\"Mr. Pole?\" he said.\n",
      "\"Mr. Pole,\" repeated that gentleman.\n",
      "\"Mr. _Fred_ Pole?\" asked Bones, with an air of surprise.\n",
      "\"Mr. Fred Pole,\" admitted the other soberly.\n",
      "Bones looked from the card to the visitor as though he could not\n",
      "believe his eyes.\n",
      "\"We have a letter from you somewhere,\" he said, searching the desk.\n",
      "\"Ah, here it is!\"  (It was, in fact, the only document on the table.)\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, to be sure.  I'm very glad to meet you.\"\n",
      "He rose, solemnly shook hands, sat down again and coughed.  Then he\n",
      "took up the ivory paper-knife to chew, coughed again as he detected the\n",
      "lapse, and put it down with a bang.\n",
      "\"I thought I'd like to come along and see you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred\n",
      "in his gentle voice; \"we are so to speak, associated in business.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed?\" said Bones.  \"In-deed?\"\n",
      "\"You see, Mr. Tibbetts,\" Fred went on, with a sad smile, \"your lamented\n",
      "uncle, before he went out of business, sold us his ships.  He died a\n",
      "month later.\"\n",
      "He sighed and Bones sighed.\n",
      "\"Your uncle was a great man, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, \"one of the\n",
      "greatest business men in this little city.  What a man!\"\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said Bones, shaking his head mournfully.\n",
      "He had never met his uncle and had seldom heard of him.  Saul Tibbetts\n",
      "was reputedly a miser, and his language was of such violence that the\n",
      "infant Augustus was invariably hurried to the nursery on such rare\n",
      "occasions as old Saul paid a family visit.  His inheritance had come to\n",
      "Bones as in a dream, from the unreality of which he had not yet\n",
      "awakened.\n",
      "\"I must confess, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred, \"that I have often had\n",
      "qualms of conscience about your uncle, and I have been on the point of\n",
      "coming round to see you several times.  This morning I said to my\n",
      "brother, 'Joe,' I said, 'I'm going round to see Tibbetts.'  Forgive the\n",
      "familiarity, but we talk of firms like the Rothschilds and the Morgans\n",
      "without any formality.\"\n",
      "\"Naturally, naturally, naturally,\" murmured Bones gruffly.\n",
      "\"I said: 'I'll go and see Tibbetts and get it off my chest.  If he\n",
      "wants those ships back at the price we paid for them, or even less, he\n",
      "shall have them.'  'Fred,' he said, 'you're too sensitive for\n",
      "business.'  'Joe,' I said, 'my conscience works even in business\n",
      "hours.'\"\n",
      "A light dawned on Bones and he brightened visibly.\n",
      "\"Ah, yes, my dear old Pole,\" he said almost cheerily, \"I understand.\n",
      "You diddled my dear old uncle--bless his heart--out of money, and you\n",
      "want to pay it back.  Fred\"--Bones rose and extended his knuckly\n",
      "hand--\"you're a jolly old sportsman, and you can put it there!\"\n",
      "\"What I was going to say----\" began Fred seriously agitated.\n",
      "\"Not a word.  We'll have a bottle on this.  What will you\n",
      "have--ginger-beer or cider?\"\n",
      "Mr. Fred suppressed a shudder with difficulty.\n",
      "\"Wait, wait, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he begged; \"I think I ought to explain.  We\n",
      "did not, of course, knowingly rob your uncle----\"\n",
      "\"No, no, naturally,\" said Bones, with a facial contortion which passed\n",
      "for a wink.  \"Certainly not.  We business men never rob anybody.  Ali,\n",
      "bring the drinks!\"\n",
      "\"We did not consciously rob him,\" continued Mr. Fred desperately, \"but\n",
      "what we did do---- ah, this is my confession!\"\n",
      "\"You borrowed a bit and didn't pay it back.  Ah, naughty!\" said Bones.\n",
      "\"Out with the corkscrew, Ali.  What shall it be--a cream soda or\n",
      "non-alcoholic ale?\"\n",
      "Mr. Fred looked long and earnestly at the young man.\n",
      "\"Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, and suddenly grasped the hand of Bones, \"I\n",
      "hope we are going to be friends.  I like you.  That's my peculiarity--I\n",
      "like people or I dislike them.  Now that I've told you that we bought\n",
      "two ships from your uncle for one hundred and forty thousand pounds\n",
      "when we knew--yes, positively knew--they were worth at least twenty\n",
      "thousand pounds more--now I've told you this, I feel happier.\"\n",
      "\"Worth twenty thousand pounds more?\" said Bones thoughtfully.\n",
      "Providence was working overtime for him, he thought.\n",
      "\"Of anybody's money,\" said Fred stoutly.  \"I don't care where you go,\n",
      "my dear chap.  Ask Cole--he's the biggest shipping lawyer in this\n",
      "city--ask my brother, who, I suppose, is the greatest shipping\n",
      "authority in the world, or--what's the use of asking 'em?--ask\n",
      "yourself.  If you're not Saul Tibbetts all over again, if you haven't\n",
      "the instinct and the eye and the brain of a shipowner--why, I'm a\n",
      "Dutchman!  That's what I am--a Dutchman!\"\n",
      "He picked up his hat and his lips were pressed tight--a gesture and a\n",
      "grimace which stood for grim conviction.\n",
      "\"What are they worth to-day?\" asked Bones, after a pause.\n",
      "\"What are they worth to-day?\"  Mr. Fred frowned heavily at the ceiling.\n",
      "\"Now, what are they worth to-day?  I forget how much I've spent on\n",
      "'em--they're in dock now.\"\n",
      "Bones tightened _his_ lips, too.\n",
      "\"They're in dock now?\" he said.  He scratched his nose.  \"Dear old Fred\n",
      "Pole,\" he said, \"you're a jolly old soul.  By Jove that's not bad!\n",
      "'Pole' an' 'soul' rhyme--did you notice it?\"\n",
      "Fred had noticed it.\n",
      "\"It's rum,\" said Bones, shaking his head, \"it is rum how things get\n",
      "about.  How did you know, old fellow-citizen, that I was going in for\n",
      "shippin'?\"\n",
      "Mr. Fred Pole did not know that Bones was going in for shipping, but he\n",
      "smiled.\n",
      "\"There are few things that happen in the City that I _don't_ know,\" he\n",
      "admitted modestly.\n",
      "\"The Tibbetts Line,\" said Bones firmly, \"will fly a house-flag of\n",
      "purple and green diagonally--that is, from corner to corner.  There\n",
      "will be a yellow anchor in a blue wreath in one corner and a capital T\n",
      "in a red wreath in the other.\"\n",
      "\"Original, distinctly original,\" said Fred in wondering admiration.\n",
      "\"Wherever did you get that idea?\"\n",
      "\"I get ideas,\" confessed Bones, blushing, \"some times in the night,\n",
      "sometimes in the day.  The fleet\"--Bones liked the sound of the word\n",
      "and repeated it--\"the fleet will consist of the _Augustus_, the\n",
      "_Sanders_--a dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead--the\n",
      "_Patricia_--another dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead, too--in\n",
      "fact, in the same house.  To tell you the truth, dear old Fred Pole,\n",
      "she's married to the other ship.  And there'll be the _Hamilton_,\n",
      "another precious old soul, a very, very, very, very dear friend of mine\n",
      "who's comin' home shortly----\"\n",
      "\"Well, what shall we say, Mr. Tibbetts?\" said Fred, who had an early\n",
      "luncheon appointment.  \"Would you care to buy the two boats at the same\n",
      "price we gave your uncle for them?\"\n",
      "Bones rang his bell.\n",
      "\"I'm a business man, dear old Fred,\" said he soberly.  \"There's no time\n",
      "like the present, and I'll fix the matter--_now!_\"\n",
      "He said \"now\" with a ferociousness which was intended to emphasize his\n",
      "hard and inflexible business character.\n",
      "Fred came into the private office of Pole & Pole after lunch that day,\n",
      "and there was in his face a great light and a peace which was almost\n",
      "beautiful.\n",
      "But never beamed the face of Fred so radiantly as the countenance of\n",
      "the waiting Joe.  He lay back in his chair, his cigar pointing to the\n",
      "ceiling.\n",
      "\"Well, Fred?\"--there was an anthem in his voice.\n",
      "\"Very well, Joe.\"  Fred hung up his unnecessary umbrella.\n",
      "\"I've sold the _Fairies_!\"\n",
      "Joe said it and Fred said it.  They said it together.  There was the\n",
      "same lilt of triumph in each voice, and both smiles vanished at the\n",
      "identical instant.\n",
      "\"_You've_ sold the _Fairies_!\" they said.\n",
      "They might have been rehearsing this scene for months, so perfect was\n",
      "the chorus.\n",
      "\"Wait a bit, Joe,\" said Fred; \"let's get the hang of this.  I\n",
      "understand that you left the matter to me.\"\n",
      "\"I did; but, Fred, I was so keen on the idea I had that I had to nip in\n",
      "before you.  Of course, I didn't go to him as Pole & Pole----\"\n",
      "\"To him?  What him?\" asked Fred, breathing hard.\n",
      "\"To What's-his-name--Bones.\"\n",
      "Fred took his blue silk handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\"Go on, Joe,\" he said sadly\n",
      "\"I got him just before he went out to lunch.  I sent up the United\n",
      "Merchant Shippers' card--it's our company, anyway.  Not a word about\n",
      "Pole & Pole.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Fred.\n",
      "\"And, my boy,\"--this was evidently Joe's greatest achievement, for he\n",
      "described the fact with gusto--\"not a word about the names of the\n",
      "ships.  I just sold him two steamers, so and so tonnage, so and so\n",
      "classification----\"\n",
      "\"For how much?\"\n",
      "Fred was mildly curious.  It was the curiosity which led a certain\n",
      "political prisoner to feel the edge of the axe before it beheaded him.\n",
      "\"A hundred and twenty thousand!\" cried Joe joyously.  \"He's starting a\n",
      "fleet, he says.  He's calling it the Tibbetts Line, and bought a couple\n",
      "of ships only this morning.\"\n",
      "Fred examined the ceiling carefully before he spoke.\n",
      "\"Joe,\" he said, \"was it a firm deal?  Did you put pen to paper?\"\n",
      "\"You-bet-your-dear-sweet-life,\" said Joe, scornful at the suggestion\n",
      "that he had omitted such an indispensable part of the negotiation.\n",
      "\"So did I, Joe,\" said Fred.  \"Those two ships he bought were the two\n",
      "_Fairies_.\"\n",
      "There was a dead silence.\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Joe uneasily, after a while, \"we can get a couple of\n",
      "ships----\"\n",
      "\"Where, Joe?  You admitted yesterday there weren't two boats in the\n",
      "world on the market.\"\n",
      "Another long silence.\n",
      "\"I did it for the best, Fred.\"\n",
      "Fred nodded\n",
      "\"Something must be done.  We can't sell a man what we haven't got.\n",
      "Joe, couldn't you go and play golf this afternoon whilst I wangle this\n",
      "matter out?\"\n",
      "Joe nodded and rose solemnly.  He took down his umbrella from the peg\n",
      "and his shiny silk hat from another peg, and tiptoed from the room.\n",
      "From three o'clock to four Mr. Fred Pole sat immersed in thought, and\n",
      "at last, with a big, heavy sigh, he unlocked his safe, took out his\n",
      "cheque-book and pocketed it.\n",
      "Bones was on the point of departure, after a most satisfactory day's\n",
      "work, when Fred Pole was announced.\n",
      "Bones greeted him like unto a brother--caught him by the hand at the\n",
      "very entrance and, still holding him thus, conducted him to one of his\n",
      "beautiful chairs.\n",
      "\"By Jove, dear old Fred,\" he babbled, \"it's good of you, old\n",

    "\n",
    "The string returned by `__repr__` should be unambiguous and, if possible, **match the source code necessary to recreate the object** being represented. That is why our chosen representation looks like calling the constructor of the class, e.g. `Book('The Book of Silence', 'Nobody', [])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast `__repr__` with `__str__`, which is called by the `str()` constructor and **implicitly used by the print function**. `__str__` should return **a string suitable for display to end-users**.\n",
    "\n",

    "If you only implement one of these special methods, choose `__repr__`, because when no custom `__str__` is available, Python will call `__repr__` as a fallback.\n",

    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class you are writing is a specialized version of another -readily available- class, you can use inheritance to implement your extensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When one class inherits from another, it automatically takes on all the attributes and methods of the first class. The original class is called the *parent class*, and the new class is the *child class*. The child class inherits every attribute and method from its parent class but is also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The __init__() Method for a Child Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task Python has when creating an instance from a child class is to assign values to all attributes in the parent class. To do this, the `__init__()` method for a child class needs help from its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let’s model a comic book. A comic book is just a specific kind of book, with less text and more images :). Consequently, we can base our new `ComicBook` class on the `Book` class we wrote earlier. Then we’ll only have to write code for the attributes and behavior specific to comic books.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a child class, the parent class **must be part of the current file and must appear before the child class in the file**. The name of the parent class must be included in parentheses in the definition of the child class. The `__init__()` method takes the information required to make a `ComicBook` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` function is a special function that helps Python make connections between the parent and child class. It tells Python to call the `__init__()` method from `ComicBook`’s parent class, which gives a `ComicBook` instance all the attributes of its parent class. The name super comes from a convention of calling the parent class a **superclass** and the child class a **subclass**."
