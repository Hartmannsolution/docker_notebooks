# Semester exam project
## Part 1: Data collection and cleaning
Due date: 21.03.2023
You are required to do the following in groups before the next class (21.03.2023):
1. Find an interesting business case that you want to work with. The business case should be:
  - related to data science and machine learning.
  - interesting to you.
  - based on real data. You are not allowed to use data that you have created yourself.
2. You should think about where you can collect the data.
3. You should think about how you can clean the data.
4. You should think about how you can visualize the data (drawing out insights from the data).
5. You should think about how you can model the data (e.g. make predictions, categorization, image analysis).
  - For this part you may not feel ready to come up with ideas yet, but you can make some research and see what projects people are doing with machine learning and data science and use this as inspiration.
  - Your initial ideas may later be changed, but you should start the process of thinking about how you can use machine learning and data science to solve the business case.
6. when we meet, we will talk about scope, ambition, and feasibility of your project.
7. when we meet we will also spend time on the learning objectives that you have prepared for the next class.
