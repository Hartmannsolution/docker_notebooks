## Student Presentations Guidelines
A class presentation is a great way to share your knowledge with your fellow students. It is also a great way to practice your presentation skills. The following guidelines are intended to help you prepare for your presentation.
1. **Choose a topic** from the list of topics/activities for a specific session. 
  - It should be something that you are interested in and that you would like to learn more about. 
  - It should be something that you can present in the given time frame. Each activity has a suggested time frame:
    - 2-3 minutes for small topics
    - 4-5 minutes for medium topics
    - 6-8 minutes for large topics
  - Think about how to make it relevant and usable to your fellow students.
